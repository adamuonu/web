    "section": "",
    "text": "Nigeria is Africa’s most populous country and the continent’s largest economy. However, it lags on several critical measures of health. The country ranks near the bottom of the league for the population’s health. There is a gap between the current realities of the Nigerian health system and the expectations regarding the system. Within that gap lies opportunities to increase investment in health and improve Nigerians’ health outcomes.\nIndicators such as healthy life expectancy (HLE) and measures of disease burden like maternal mortality ratio (per 100,000 births) and under-five mortality rate (per 1000 live births) emphasize the poor performance of the Nigerian health system. HLE is a clear, consistent, and important population health outcome measure that can inform judgments about the value of health care investment. HLE is also an important guide to evaluating resource allocation for health care systems. (Stiefel et al., 2010) Current health expenditure (CHE) indicates the level of resources channelled to health relative to other uses. CHE shows the importance of the health sector in the whole economy and indicates the priority of health measured in monetary terms. (World Health Organization, 2022a)\nIn 2019, Nigerians’ life expectancy and healthy life expectancy were 62.6 years and 54.4 years. Maternal mortality in 2017 was 917. The under-five mortality rate was 114 per 1000 live births. Half of the 5 million under-five deaths in 2020 occurred in just Nigeria and four other countries. (World Health Organization, 2022b) A higher public health expenditure significantly decreases child and maternal mortality and increases life expectancy. (Rana et al., 2018) Public health expenditure has a negative correlation with infant mortality and under-five mortality. (Yaqub et al., 2012) The following five charts highlight the poor investment in health, inefficiency and waste that commonly occurs. The data used to generate these charts are from 1) the Global Health Expenditure Database and 2) the Global Health Observatory."

    "text": "Out of pocket expenditure as percentage of current health expenditure\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Out-of-pocket expenditure as % of current health expenditure and healthy life expectancy\n\n\n\n\nOut-of-pocket expenditure in Nigeria is 162.3% of current health expenditure. As shown in Figure 2, this is quite a significant portion of the total current health expenditure and highlights health care financing gaps. It also indicates that most of the population has a high risk of financial distress in the event of severe health challenges. We can see a clear negative relationship between the proportion of out-of-pocket spending and healthy life expectancy. Higher out-of-pocket spending on health indicates poor health system financing, which the population tries to remedy through out-of-pocket spending."

There is a positive relationship between social health insurance as a percentage of current health expenditure and healthy life expectancy. As in Figure 1, we notice that several countries with similar proportions of social health insurance spending rank higher than Nigeria on life expectancy. Waste and inefficiency seem to be recurring themes."

However, Figure 5 reveals a more nuanced picture. Expenditure on primary health care contributes more to current health expenditure because overall health budgets are small."

    "title": "The importance of visualizing your data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The visualization of your data is very important especially during the exploratory stages of data analysis. Data visualization may reveal relationships that may not otherwise be apparent. Also, important results can be communicated lucidly to your audience through graphs and charts.\nConsider this data set of 912 observations (Table 1 shows the first 10 rows of the data):\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: First few rows of data set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nencounter_date\nnumber_of_patients\nnumber_of_doctors\nmean_wait_time\n\n\n\n\n2020-01-01\n120\n15\n16.49\n\n\n2020-01-02\n402\n50\n59.59\n\n\n2020-01-03\n363\n48\n43.4\n\n\n2020-01-04\n181\n15\n29.6\n\n\n2020-01-05\n130\n14\n17.53\n\n\n2020-01-06\n463\n54\n64.54\n\n\n2020-01-07\n474\n55\n63.67\n\n\n2020-01-08\n442\n49\n58.72\n\n\n2020-01-09\n509\n59\n62.84\n\n\n2020-01-10\n430\n55\n53.56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuppose we wish to examine the hypothesis that there is a relationship between the number of patients checking into the hospital on any given day and the daily average waiting time. We could do that using correlation and report a correlation coefficient. Thus from our data of 362,305 patient records from the hospital’s electronic medical records for the period of January 2020 to June 2022, we can calculate a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of r = 0.84 (95% CI 0.82, 0.85), p < 0.01. This result suggests a strong positive linear relationship between the daily number of patients and the daily average waiting time.\n\nScatterplots\nWhat do we see when we plot the data i.e. a scatterplot of daily patient number against daily mean waiting time? Figure 1 reveals something interesting. As expected from the correlation coefficient above, the regression line shows a strong positive relationship. However, what stands out is that the data is clustered into two groups suggesting group differences.\nIf we were to colour the data points by whether the day was a weekend (Saturday or Sunday) or a weekday (Monday to Friday), the nature of the clustering becomes clearer (Figure 2). Also, the slopes of the regression lines are different for weekdays compared to weekends. Respectively the correlation coefficients are r = 0.67 (0.63, 0.71), p < 0.01 for weekdays, and r = 0.64 (0.57, 0.71), p < 0.01 for weekends.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Daily number of patients vs. daily mean waiting time\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Clustering of observations by weekday\n\n\n\n\nThe confounding introduced by whether the day is a regular weekday or a weekend was revealed when we plotted the data. This is confirmed by the decrease in the correlation coefficients when we accounted for weekday. Therefore any subsequent analyses must account for the influence of weekday (see Table 3).\n\n\n\nWe can reasonably expect that having more doctors on duty might reduce the average waiting time. We can therefore test the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between the daily number of available doctors and the daily average waiting time. There is a statistically significant relationship between the number of doctors on duty and the daily average waiting time: r = 0.80 (95% CI 0.77, 0.82), p < 0.01. We can also make a scatterplot of this relationship (Figure 3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Overall regression line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) By weekday groups\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Number of doctors and waiting time\n\n\nWe see here that the clustering by weekday type is even more accentuated. We also see that the relationship between number of doctors and waiting times is in the opposite direction to what we expected. Why is this? It is likely as more patients check into the hospital, more doctors are placed on the roster. In other words, the increase in the number of doctors is a response to increased patient numbers. The correlation coefficients are r = 0.56 (0.5, 0.61), p < 0.01 for weekdays, and r = 0.53 (0.43, 0.61), p < 0.01 for weekends. Again highlighting the confounding imposed by weekend or weekday. It is possible that there is an interaction effect between the number of doctors on duty and weekday type: there will be relatively less doctors on duty given the same number of patients on weekends compared to weekdays.\n\n\n\nThis leads us to consider the relationship between daily patient numbers and daily number of doctors on the roster (Figure 4). The difference between weekdays and weekends is even more pronounced. The point and interval estimates for the overall correlation coefficient is r = 0.92 (0.91, 0.93) while they are r = 0.82 (0.8, 0.85) for weekdays, and r = 0.67 (0.59, 0.73) for weekends respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Overall regression line\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) By weekday groups\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Daily number of patients vs. daily number of doctors\n\n\n\n\nRegression models\nWe now arrive at the point where we can attempt to develop an explanatory model for daily average waiting time (Equation 1):\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_{1} \\times \\text{daily patient number} + \\beta_{2} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\\\ &+ \\beta_{3} \\times \\text{weekend} + \\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(y\\) = daily average waiting time\n\\(\\beta_0\\) = constant term\n\\(\\beta_1\\), \\(\\beta_2\\), \\(\\beta_3\\) = regression coefficients, and\n\\(\\epsilon\\) = residual error term\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Linear regression model of predictors of mean patient waiting time\n\n\n \nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\n(intercept)\n26.27\n2.426\n10.83\n<0.001\n\n\nnumber of patients\n0.109\n0.007\n15.42\n<0.001\n\n\nnumber of doctors\n-0.011\n0.076\n-0.15\n0.881\n\n\nweekends\n-8.425\n1.997\n-4.22\n<0.001\n\n\nN\n912\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(R^2\\)\n0.71\n\n\n\n\n\nadjusted \\(R^2\\)\n0.709\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC\n7200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the linear regression model are shown in Table 2. On average patients will wait about 8 minutes less on weekends. The model shows that there is not a statistically significant relationship between the number of doctors and daily average waiting time after adjusting for the effects of number of patients and weekend. So the earlier relationship we found for the relationship between the number of doctors and daily average waiting time is spurious.\nThe adjusted \\(R^2 = 0.709\\) suggests that this model explains about 71% of the variation in the data. Does the performance of the model improve if we include the interaction between weekend and number of doctors (Equation 2)? The results in Table 3 suggest there is only a marginal improvement (adjusted \\(R^2 = 0.717\\)), however the ANOVA test comparing the two models (not shown) indicates this second model is better. We can plot the standardized coefficients as a forest plot (Figure 5) to show which variable has the most influence on daily average time.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ny = \\beta_0 &+ \\beta_{1} \\times \\text{daily patient number} + \\beta_{2} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\\\ &+ \\beta_{3} \\times \\text{weekend} + \\beta_{4} \\times \\text{daily doctor number}\\cdot\\text{weekend} +\\epsilon\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Linear regression model of predictors of mean patient waiting time with interaction term\n\n\n \nB\nSE\nt\np\n\n\n\n\n(intercept)\n28.34\n2.426\n11.68\n<0.001\n\n\nnumber of patients\n0.106\n0.007\n15\n<0.001\n\n\nnumber of doctors\n-0.017\n0.074\n-0.23\n0.816\n\n\nweekends\n-30.29\n4.68\n-6.47\n<0.001\n\n\nnumber of doctors · weekend\n1.363\n0.265\n5.15\n<0.001\n\n\nN\n912\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(R^2\\)\n0.719\n\n\n\n\n\nadjusted \\(R^2\\)\n0.717\n\n\n\n\n\nAIC\n7176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe weekday is the most influential variable on average waiting time, having the largest standardized coefficient \\(\\beta = 1.19\\) while there is also a statistically significant interaction effect between the number of doctors and whether it is a weekend or not.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Forest plot of standardized regression coefficients\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBut then this confirms what we can already infer from observation and commonsense. Patients spend longer minutes waiting when there are more of them. The number of doctors on duty increases in response to increased patient numbers but does not improve the waiting time. There are less doctors available on weekends."
